# AgeBypassPoC

The repository follows this post of mine, [Age Verification Bypass - Google/PrivateID](https://doxrgithub.github.io/doxrblogs/posts/googleage/). This extension can automatically verify the primary authenticated user of the browser as an adult (as of 12/11/2025), if their settings were locked for being a minor.

You can install this extension manually on chrome://extensions; use the Load Unpacked button.

*Disclaimer: usage of this repository to attempt bypassing age verification is not recommended. I take no responsiblity for what you do! The source code has been released solely for informative use.*
